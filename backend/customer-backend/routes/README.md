# 🛣️ Routes – RydFixr Backend

The **Routes** folder in the RydFixr backend defines all the API endpoints that connect frontend requests to backend logic.  
Each route file maps incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller functions, ensuring a clean, modular, and scalable backend structure.

## 🚀 Overview

In RydFixr, routes serve as the **entry points** for all customer and Fixpert interactions.  
They handle actions like registration, OTP verification, login, booking management, and dashboard data retrieval.  

Each route file is paired with a corresponding controller that executes the core business logic — keeping the application organized and easy to maintain.
